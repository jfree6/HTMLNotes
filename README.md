##HTML

###Chapter 1 Notes

  HTML uses several tags to control how text is displayed on the page.

  These tags can contain attributes to alter the appearance and function of the
  contained object/text.

  Attributes consist of a name and value.

  Some commonly used tags:

| Tag | Use |
| --- | --- |
| html | opening/closing of an html segment |
| body | opening/closing of the body of a page|
| h1 | Heading |
| h2,3,... | Sub-headings |
| p | Paragraph text |
| head | Header for the page(info about page) |
| title | title of page |

You can view the "source" of a page to see the html used to create that page.
